    <h1>Comprehensive Guide to Web Development for Beginners</h1>

    <p>Web development is an essential skill in the digital age, enabling the creation and maintenance of websites and web applications. This guide provides resources, methodologies, and insights to help beginners navigate their journey into web development effectively.</p>

    <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
    <p>Web development encompasses the tasks involved in creating and maintaining websites. It includes front-end development, which deals with the visual aspects users interact with, and back-end development, which manages server-side functions. The most common programming languages used in web development include HTML, CSS, JavaScript for front-end, and languages like Python, Ruby, PHP, and Java for back-end development.</p>

    <h2>Why Learn Web Development?</h2>
    <p>With over 5.30 billion people connected to the internet, web development is a rapidly growing industry. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projects a job growth rate of 13% for web developers between now and 2030. Acquiring web development skills can enhance your career, allow for freelance opportunities, or even pave the way for starting your own online business.</p>

    <h2>Learning Path for Beginners</h2>
